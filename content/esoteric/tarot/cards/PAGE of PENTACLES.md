The Page of Pentacles is the most studious of the bunch. She is ambitious and diligent; a strong, goal-oriented planner. She is grounded, loyal, faithful, and dependable, and above all, focused on what is most important to her.

I love what [Spiral Sea Tarot](https://www.spiralseatarot.com/blog/indepthpageofpentacles) says about her:
>  If the Page arrives and you (or the seeker) aren't certain of her connection, you may regard this card as a messenger rather than a list of attributes to embody. What this could mean is that the Page has arrived for you in this moment to let you know, in more prophetic terms, that something will be offered to you, and _that_ something will likely be an opportunity to apply your skills for some form of monetary gain.
