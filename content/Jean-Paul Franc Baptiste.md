Okay so this is my dnd character, I'm learning to roleplay

![[matchi-cayden-riso.png]]

Bounjour, I'm Jean-Paul, I'm a half-elf monk from Monastère Étoilé in Chǎletmont. I've been living with the sages here for about 5 years now; but before enrolling into my cohort, I grew up traveling with mother[^1]. I actually used to live on the farm with my twin sister, but that was a long time ago. After the divorce, from when I was 9 until I was 14, mother took me across the land to many temples, academies, and universities for her work trips. She would bring me everywhere, and sit me in the library where I would read about the machinations of the multiverse.

But while I *liked* the books... I *hated* being stuck in one place. One time, after mother finished up a particularly late night at the university, she came in looking for me... only to find me crawling halfway up the construction scaffolding. I think that was the point where she realized I actually needed someone to pay attention to me, and help me channel my energy, so pretty soon after I found myself living at Monastère Étoilé.

Étoilé's great. I've learned a lot...



[^1]: I reference her as "mother" instead of "my mother" because I just assume everyone already knows her.
