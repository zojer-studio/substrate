I find over-and-over that there are three levels of understanding:
1. Student
2. Over-confident
3. Student-teacher

At the first level, you're fresh-eyed and open-minded. You aren't yet bogged down by [[Expectation|expectations]], which means you are simultaneously: unequipped to appropriately handle the situation, yet able to compensate with a learning mentality.

The second level is where you've now got a bit of experience under your belt. You've been through it enough times where you know what to anticipate, and how to react to it. But a problem starts to arise; the strategies you've learned seem to stop working. Here's what's happened:
- [[Knowledge]] is *dynamic*.
- Although the core truth underlying it is constant, the framing is not—and will fail as new, conflicting situations arise.
- At first, you don't even notice that your "knowledge" is failing you. Up until this point, it's worked pretty well—and your [[Ego|overconfidence]] blinds you.
- Then, you start to question yourself, your own self-worth. You start to feel the imposter syndrome. And as a result, life gets much more difficult; uncomfortable; painful. 

It's not until you recognize this dynamic; humble yourself; and re-adopt a learning mentality that you can master knowledge and disseminate it to others. The lessons you learn from one situation don't always apply to another. You *have* to update your understanding if you want to stay fresh.

I don't think you ever lose knowledge. Even if a learned lesson fails you, it doesn't mean that lesson should be discarded. (This is the [[Reverse entropy principle]] in action.)

What I find interesting is that these humps seem to appear at both a micro- and macro-level. They're [[Fractals|Fractal]]—patterns that repeat themselves, infinitely, all the way up and all the way down. It can apply to a hard skill, just as it applies to the meta-level soft skill. And—I think—with more and more compounding experiences under your belt, you start to find it easier to digest humps across the board. Which is a clue!

I believe that pushing past these humps is what life is all about.[^1]  I'll talk about this[^2] in much greater depth later, but each time you digest a hump, you:
1. Increase physical entropy
2. Decrease spiritual entropy

Although this process is painful, it seems to be fundamental—and very very good for you. (Which means it's good for the universe, too)[^3].
