## This bug and I are symbiotic
I can feel his energy, he just wants attention lol. He knows I'm a living creature, and we interact with that shared understanding. It kind of makes me feel like a parent. He wants attention. I find him fascinating.

(He's cleaning himself rn. Now, he's crawling around on my screen.)

He can feel gravity (you can see it in his limbs), so I must help him get to his destination (my face). Only, I don't want him to *get* to his destination—I just want to aid him on his quest.

He doesn't have a name, for he is nameless. Ego defines him completely—aware that he is a separate entity from this world, yet at the same time one with all.

It's quite beautiful! Now he's crawling up to my shirt to try to get my face again. I wonder if he can perceive the attention I'm giving him. I can tell all this crawling has gotten him a lil tired now.

(My bracelets are his climbing gym. He just goes around, and around, and around lol)
