So this is in-progress; I'm trying to figure out how to communicate this all.

Here's a first draft:

## Metaphysics are pretty cool
Hi, I'm [[david]], and I like metaphysics. I think about them a lot—in fact, I'm *fixated* on them. I find them everywhere, as if every path leads to Rome; in every situation, I find my attention inevitably pulled to the recurring meta-patterns at play. 

I think about these patterns in every single social interaction; every emotion; even in my dreams—and while this is sometimes to my detriment, every day I find myself settling further into a compounding state of [[Awe]]: which I believe to be the very essence of fulfillment.

## The substrate
What is [[the substrate]]? Well, it's this idea that there is some strange *substance* that permeates through *everything*. More specifically, it's a substance that expresses itself both physically and spiritually. It is a flow of energy both infinitely complex and infinitely simple—paradoxically [[Yin]], while at the same time [[Yang]].

Now, I'm aware that this all sounds very 'woo'—which unfortunately has this affect of pushing people away from these concepts.[^1] But I urge you to consider: Have you ever noticed that [[Everything is waves]]? Every **'thing'**[^2] seems to sit at the intersection point between many different **'spectrums'**.[^3] For example: Recently, I have been fascinated by the idea that: [[The two poles of autism are ADHD and OCD]].  It's wild because I promise you, in every single situation—when you break it down to first principles—you will *always* find a spectrum at play.

I'm of the belief that these spectrums are observable—but not always through scientific instruments (blasphemy, I know). Oftentimes, the only way we *can* observe truth is through the subjective experiences of our bodies. For some, this can be a big psychological hurdle, given our culture's obsession with rationality. But frankly, if you keep an open mind, and notice that these waves/spectrums are *everywhere*—it becomes impossible to ignore the underlying tautological logic of the colloquial "subjective." Or, more simply, what we consider to be irrational is, actually, very rational.[^4]

## What's the use?[^5]
Ambiguity is uncomfortable to hold. The ego, our differentiating component, reeeally wants to collapse it down into its two poles. This is why people with a 'big ego' are often the least able to handle ambiguity.

But you can practice sitting in the middle. The Taoists call this [[Wu Wei (無為)]]; a state of doing-non-doing. And it is by following your wu wei that you are able to learn the richest lessons life has to offer.

With much help, I've come to discover that [[The purpose of life is to learn lessons]]—and it is from this atomic concept that everything follows suit.

When all this clicks for you, that's where you really get pulled into realizing: there is some real, funky stuff going on in this universe.
