This is one of the foundations of [[Partnership]]. When a new ship bands together, it first needs to go through the process of figuring out:
- which functions drain our energy?
- which functions boost our energy?

For example, how do you handle the dishes? Do you deal with them right away, or let them pile? How do you balance these responsibilties with the many others partnership demands?

I started thinking about this when I had the realization today that my parents have no idea how to run a ship together. Neither of them know how to cook, and their systems for organization are completely separate. There is very little exchange between the two of them outside of their pressure points (e.g. the sprinklers). Somehow, they make it work, and I think it's because they've mostly given up reaching the same [[Wavelength]], over these things.

If I find myself in a situation like them, then so be it! I will learn from the experience. But at least I'll know how to cook ðŸ˜œ
