They say... (to be continued l8r allig8r)

I had a bit of a breakthrough in clarity just now: that I'm too weird for most people (not a new idea, just a clearer one). I'm too random, too unpredictable (because I've got my attention in so many different places), and most people aren't equipped to handle that.

My brain jumps instantly to really neat conclusions, or insights, but very rarely do people follow where my brain is going.
