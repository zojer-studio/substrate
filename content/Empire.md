> Empire is synonymous with monoculture, because that is how it reproduces. It layers on top of what is already there, and smothers—like a pillow across your face.

I was introduced to the idea of empire at North Star Campout, where @aiden_wachter gave a talk on his perspective on wtf is wrong with our world today. Basically, he made the case that empire is the (living) archetype responsible for all the fucking gunk that comes with capitalism, colonialism, patriarchy, etc. It's the blatant disregard for peoples sovereignity. It's the way elon musk says most people are NPCs. It's a pattern that once you take note of, you'll find it *everywhere*—both big and small.

## The destruction of diversity

Empire seeks to *conquer*, and it does so through *homogenization*. Here's how it goes: every archetype wants to expand its influence. Animals have sex to spread their genes. Humans share ideas in hopes that those ideas will spread to others. Empire finds *things* outside its grasp, and forces it to conform—stripping away their diversity. 

When empire colonizes a new environment, it manipulates people into rejecting their culture, and converting to the empire's culture. Some examples:
- The [American Indian boarding schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_boarding_schools), whose objective was to "civilize" or assimilate Native American children into Anglo-American culture. In the process, it forced them to give up their languages, traditions, and *diversity*. 
- **Colonialism** invades a culture to extract its wealth, until all that remains is a husk of its former glory. The diversity of a culture becomes commodified, as its roots are severed and its core is transformed into an offshoot of the monoculture.
- **Consumerism** promises comfort in exchange for your *diversity*. It provides a frictionless experience that convinces people to give up their old ways. We can observe this through clothing--all across the world, people have given up traditional garments for t-shirts.
- **Empiricism** asserts that truth can only be found via measurable changes in the material world. There is only one way to find truth, and it is in the scientific method. Even if alternative, immeasurable methods arrive at the same conclusion—or even *enhance* said conclusion—their "subjective" nature leads to a rejection of their validity.
- The **insurance industry** simplifies people's complex experiences into a flowchart.
- **Capitalism** convinces people that the purpose of life is to generate profit. I.e., effort is only valuable if it generates more value than what's been put in. This has homogenized the scope of livelihoods—if you don't "contribute" to the profit machine, then you are selfishly refusing to contribute to the community, and should be exiled as a result.
- **Monotheism** presents the idea of "one true god". In this, it lambasts alternative descriptions of god by labeling them as heresy. Although religion is an extremely effective scaffolding that helps people connect with their spirituality, it tricks them into believing that other forms of scaffolding lead to different ends.
- **Patriarchy** assumes its role as the arbiter of validity. It rejects contributions that do not fall within the lanes it has designated. By convincing the world that traditionally masculine traits are the source of good, and traditionally feminine traits are the source of bad (which is consistently reinforced by the english language), the patriarchy maintains control over those with different, but equally valid approaches to what is good.
- **Concrete** destroys our joints. By destroying our joints, it destroys our mobility. It makes us depend on cushioned shoes and mechanical forms of transportation. It pushes us into sedentary lifestyles, which further degrades our mobility. (Sidenote: it also somethers the existing ecosystem, which is a whole thing.)
- **Cancel culture** has streamlined ethics into absolute statements. It polices people's belief systems through moral purity tests. Certain lines of questioning have become taboo, because they are associated with the worst of the worst. In other words, it has reduced people's ability to hold two "opposing" statements in their mind at the same time.

It gets interesting (and scary) when you combine these mechanisms together. For example, the capitalist view is reinforced by the empirical view; if your contributions are spiritual in nature—because those contributions are immeasurable in shared quantitites, they are there therefore "not deserving" of compensation. Combinations like this weave an incredibly complex web that makes it harder and harder to break free of. Resistance always gets smothered, because movements are not able to build up enough momentum without being absorbed into the web. Holes get patched instantly, stronger than they were before, and the entropy is provided through their continued assimilation. So in that sense, **empire relies on infinite growth to maintain its strength.**

> Capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself. Even those who would *critique* capital end up *reinforcing* it instead.

## Waging increasingly advanced warfare

The throughline mechanic you'll find in each of these examples is that: by assimilating someone into its monoculture—it turns that someone into an agent—who then perpetuates monoculture. An easy example is a missionary: a well-intentioned person who's spirituality has been hijacked. In their desire to "spread the good word", they smother the same words uttered by others, forcing them to conform to the language of the Bible. Monoculture.

Over decades, centuries, millennia—Empire has become increasingly sophisticated at turning people into agents. In the middle ages, **feudalism** gave lords the power to smother the commonfolk through crude, physical abuse. Under the guise of providing the working class with "protection", they robbed the people of the abundance they produced. In turn, the people became drones: serving a single purpose, with no way out to escape the system.

But as drones became husks—malnourished and infected by the Black Plague—things began to turn around. No longer able to produce abundance, Empire's grip weakened, and new structures of society took its place.

It is here where we see the rise of the merchant class. As the late medieval period gave way to the **Renaissance**, an explosion in diversity allowed the people to reclaim their power from Empire. City states like Venice, Genoa, and Florence became the new centers of power. Commerce birthed new wealth, which became accessible by a greater proportion of people. The exchange of not just goods, but *ideas*, led to an explosion in diversity; mathematics, philosophy, and art became highly respected professions. And though status/birth gave one the *means* to generate ideas, what mattered most were *the ideas themselves*. The reason we look back with fondness on the Renaissance is because it championed diversity. It encouraged the sexual reproduction of ideas. And in that, it enabled us to spread our own, personal DNA.

Mistakenly, we thought this meant we won. Because, as we'll see, Empire learned how to use these new tools (the arts & sciences), and establish its grip once more. It did so through **institution**; rather than suppress diversity through crude domestic violence, (like it has done all throughout history), it learned that it could disguise itself by enforcing the rules of reproduction. Gradually, as the origins of art became centralized through reputation and schools, it constricted the types of ideas that could be circulated. For instance, art that did not display mastery over technique and mathematics was considered sub-par. Styles that challenged artistic norms (like **Impressionism**, which was considered "unfinished" and "sloppy") became coated in controversy. More to the point—people were converted into agents which suppressed sexual reproduction, in favor of asexual reproduction.

> R.F. Kuang, Babel

This presents a major technological step in Empire's ability to wage war on diversity. By embracing the ideas of the Renaissance and twisting them (e.g. high creative attainment → the concept of perfection), it enabled monarchs to take control of commerce and ultimately gave way to the **Exploration Age**—the age of expansion through colonialism.

It turns out that the new tools Empire gained from the Rennaisance were *extremely* effective at producing monoculture. By importing ideas to generate technology, it could overpower distant lands to import even more ideas. And it could retain control by exporting culture; presenting the sickly sweat nectar of civility to dull a people's wit, and sever their connection to their ancestry. 


**Manifest destiny**

> "This is how colonialism works. It convinces us that the fallout from resistance is entirely our fault, that the immoral choice is resistance itself rather than the circumstances that demanded it."
> "You have such a great fear of freedom, brother. It's shackling you. You've identified so hard with the colonizer, you think any threat to them is a threat to you. When are you going to realize you can't be one of them?"
> R.F. Kuang, Babel



It is here where we see the empire's mark of the current age start to form: **profit**.

Similarly, the Catholic Church 

Over time, it has gotten *really* good at conquest. Feudalism More to the point, we find ourself 

But at every step of the way, resistance has grown.

But we have reached a point in society where empire doesn't have much further to go. It has conquered our nervous systems; where can it go next?

Prisoner's dilemma

Embrace diverse language - we're all talking about the same thing, we're just speaking in different languages. The closer we can come to realize that, the closer we can come to the ideal prisoners dilemma -- work together, at every step of the way






The article specifically frames it in the context of the far-right, but I find it useful to take a step back and break it down into archetypes. Fundamentally, what is it these groups are doing? They're homogenizing. They are enforcing close-mindedness.

> The thing about violence, see, is that the Empire has a lot more to lose than we do. Violence disrupts the extractive economy. You wreak havoc on one supply line, and there’s a dip in prices across the Atlantic. Their entire system of trade is high-strung and vulnerable to shocks because they’ve made it thus, because the rapacious greed of capitalism is punishing. It’s why slave revolts succeed. They can’t fire on their own source of labour – it’d be like killing their own golden geese.  
> ‘But if the system is so fragile, why do we so easily accept the colonial situation? Why do we think it’s inevitable? Why doesn’t Man Friday ever get himself a rifle, or slit Robinson Crusoe’s neck in the night? The problem is that we’re always living like we’ve lost. We’re all living like you. We see their guns, their silver-work, and their ships, and we think it’s already over for us. We don’t stop to consider how even the playing field actually might be. And we never consider what things would look like if we took the gun.
