I have a theory.

One of the fundamental truths I have learned is that the basis for self-actualization is the loosening of one's grip over control. I have found, over-and-over, that letting loose and letting go is a major, *major* lesson on the course of your [[Journey]].

But letting go is easier for some, harder for others.

This can most clearly be seen in people who struggle with fixations. The operating word here is 'struggle', which is important to understand because many (if not all) [[Autism|autistic]] people are defined by their capacity to *be* fixated. The key word is 'struggle', because it is in the struggle that fixation becomes centered around [[Control]].

My theory is simple. It is that people who struggle with OCD in this lifetime have been given it to grapple with this skill. Letting go is a muscle, refined not just over this lifetime, but many more behind you, and many more ahead of you. To learn to let go is the karmic hammering of steel, moulding the hard corners of your soul into streamlined angles (like trines).

It is the unflinching mistreatment of life, to make your life harder than others. It is wholly unfair that you must struggle. Many might find the current framing offensive—treating their disability as something *bad* rather than something *empowering*. But, y'know, that's kind of exactly my point! To struggle with OCD is to go through the *[[The purpose of life is to learn lessons|lesson]]* of letting go. Nothing is more beautiful than seeing someone embrace the struggle, and come through to the other side—stronger than when they entered.

It is a beautiful thing, to witness one overcome their deepest struggle, and embrace the lesson with their whole heart.
