_Forgotten Songs is our recurring series in which we revisit a noteworthy song that has flown under the radar for too long. In this edition, Young Magic’s Isaac Emmanuel writes about Mariah’s “Shinzo No Tobira.”_

---

Some time ago I purchased an external hard drive from the store, carefully unpacked the contents, spent four hours filling it up with music I had on my computer, meticulously packaged it back up and returned it promptly to the same store. When the salesman at the counter asked if it had been opened, I returned with a pause, then uttered, “No.” He was studying my face, so I placed some extra emphasis on my denial. I could sense he had noticed the slight look away, the palpable air of sudden indecisiveness, and yet the large man opposite me had a policy to follow. I had told him no.

The idea that someone would unpack a life’s worth of songs entirely without context was too exciting for me _not_ to act on. The further from my taste the better, I had thought. I was hoping for some kind of surprise in a stranger’s routine: a momentary reset in the day…or at least my utopian idea of that situation happening. The truth was that it more likely ended up in the bargain bin of Best Buy, followed by the stomach of a dumpster, and eventually at home atop electronic landfill in Guiyu.

A forgotten song often casts a strange light. Anaïs Nin said, “We write to taste life twice, in the moment, and in retrospection.” The very nature of making a record is exactly that: to make some kind of permanent record of sound in a moment, so it can be re-experienced _beyond_ the limits of time. But a forgotten song is different; it carries with it a new type of energy. Last week I had a sense of this feeling after an impromptu visit to an abandoned resort in upstate New York. There was a moment standing inside a large empty pool where Frank Sinatra had spent his summer holidays in which I could almost hear the echoes of children playing. The Portuguese have a word for this feeling that isn’t translatable in English: a mix of happy and sad, a type of melancholia toward something once loved but since forgotten. They call it _suadade._

In retrospect, my hard drive project was a practice in freeing songs. Or something like that. And one of the artists I thought about the most when handing that little device back over the counter was a band called Mariah.

The brainchild of Japanese saxophonist and composer [Yasuaki Shimizu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuaki_Shimizu), Mariah released a short yet prolific burst of recorded material over five albums between 1980 and 1983. Their final album, the aptly titled _Utakata no Hibi_ (1983) weaves a future landscape of seventh world pop: something from the depths of Japan’s precise studio environments which simultaneously feels as if it is blindly reaching for the stars. The song _Shinzo No Tobira_ (loosely translated as _My Life Is Big_) is one of my personal favorites.

I first heard the song years ago from Melati Malay (my oracle for all good things). It begins with a warm drum loop, some soft coos, a floating synth and then the bass takes over—a rhythm not far from Eno and Byrne’s cut and paste wanderings on _My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts._ Somehow though, the experience is subtler: more from everywhere at once. The delicate, percussive timbres seemed to have a timeless quality, and the songwriting exhibited an intimacy I hadn’t felt on other recordings for some time. It was wonderful. And there it was hiding second last on side D of a double LP, at exactly 4’40” in length.

The vocals on _My Life Is Big_ seem to dance across the landscape, half-sung, half-uttered as if it they were tracked in one single, effortless take. Lyrics are split between Japanese and Armenian throughout the album. I scoured the web for translations and came up with nothing. I began to wonder if this song had even existed. A few years later though, I stumbled across a light on Yasuaki Shimizu’s site.

Lyrics: Seta Evanian, Julie Fowell
Translation from Armenian: Seta Evanian, Johnny Barrett

> _My life is big_
> _I’m walking_
> _My life is big_
> _I’m walking_
> _It’s soft wood_
> _How long_
> _The sun big_
> _New picture_
> _My heart open_
> _A little red_
> _The picture_
> _Multicoloured_
> _My heart open_
> _A little red_
> _Soft wood_
> _How long_

A quick piano chord arrives and finishes the song abruptly. A palate cleanser of sorts, like being quickly whisked away and prepared for the next five minutes: each song its own little universe. I’m sitting in a café in Montréal as rain gently pitter-patters the sidewalk and listening to it again gives me the impression it was written deliberately to soundtrack this environment. Yet I’ve had this experience with _My Life Is Big_ in so many different landscapes, such varying locales. I’m always searching for this quality in a song: a shapeshifting, protean frequency.

Yasuaki Shimizu has released a large body of work throughout his career and is probably most well known for his renditions of Bach. His _Cello Suites_ were recorded in some unconventional locations including a palazzo in Italy and a mine in Japan in order to capture the immense natural reverb of each environment. But his early left-field collaborative pop under the name Mariah lives in a different space entirely, almost like finding a naïve lover’s diary and peeking inside at the musings of a wordsmith, unable to comprehend how it could have only ever lived life under a single bed.

It’s nice to know that with the recent resurgence of interest including a Japanese re-issue of _Utakata no Hibi_ and original 12” pressings popping up online, _My Life is Big_ is one humble pool that won’t be forgotten.
