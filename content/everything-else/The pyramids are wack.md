The pyramids are so weird, everytime I learn something about them it’s like I have to take a step back because I cannot even begin to comprehend what’s going on with them. 

My mother sent me a picture with the following text:
> Three pyramids, dedicated to three generations of pharoahs. It's miraculous sunlight only enters the tomb chambers on the days they were born and ascended to the throne...

I don't even know if it's true or not—but it illustrates a certain *absurdity* that is somehow completely plausible (based on the little I already know).

*did you see this shit? what the hell is even going on? why? what? huh??*
