> This card is the [[MOON]] in [[Sagittarius]] because it is a reflection of how the emotions can impact our determination to see things through to the end. It is mutable, unpredictable, and primed for conflict. Ultimately, whether we interpret the card as good or bad, it is a card about strength. When we fear, we must find the strength to face it. And sometimes we are able to be strong because of the very fact that we are not afraid. Whether through fear or bravery, the figure in this card has met his challengers head on because he's come too far to give up now. Nine is the number of completions. Our work has come to an end and now we simply need to see our result in the 10.
