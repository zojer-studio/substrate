Okay, so this post is in three parts. The first are things this sub might find interesting to talk about. The second is a journal entry I just wrote that gets into the heart of what I think the book is all about. The third is a reflection on why the ending is so perfect.

First, to establish our [Hemn space](https://anathem.fandom.com/wiki/Hemn_Space):
- "Neal Stephenson novels don't end, they just stop." -some guy on threads
- Anathem ends with this quote: "But in that we started so many things in that moment, we brought to their ends many others that have been the subject of this account, and so here is where I draw the line across the leaf and call it the end."
- To me, the ending at first felt disatisfying, because there were SO many narrative threads at the end with so much potential! You had Gan Oso, and all of the potential politics of the Geometers. You had Fraa Jad, who—just as you the reader began to understand the power of his ability to switch narratives—just... dies. You *witness* his influence, the characters *remember* his influence, but in the final narrative he just dies. What more might he have explored, what further effects might he have had on the storyline?
- The culmination of the book is—with much Hemn space established—comprehension of what narratives are. And as I will explain below, 


With Hemn space established, here's my journal entry (even more hemn space lol). It might be kind of confusing, so I don't expect everyone to understand. But, it's a framing that works for me, and I thought it might work for others, too:

[Narrative](https://anathem.fandom.com/wiki/Narrative) is the ultimate idea of Anathem, and the way Stephenson built up to that idea is elegant, envigorating, beautiful. I loved this book so so much. He essentially establishes a mathematical, tautological framing (hemn space) for the idea that there is one true narrative—which branches off into many paths. This is where it gets quantum—but the idea is that there is **one** consciousness that chooses the branch of continuation. (note, this models exactly how we, individuals, choose what energy flows through us, and what doesn't. i.e., the gatekeeper)

Fraa Jad is a [thousander](https://anathem.fandom.com/wiki/Millenarian), and it sounds like he's a thousand years old, too. In the story, we witness him explore many different narratives to find the "right" one. Only, he already knows exactly which narratives he needs to explore, in order to accumulate and share the pieces of information that supply and feed into the main narrative.

The sci-fi part of this book, I'm not quite sold on, is that narratives which have branched off can come back to rejoin the main one. Stephenson hypothesizes this ability through the [Geometers'](https://anathem.fandom.com/wiki/Geometers) ability to travel back in time, the [Rhetors'](https://anathem.fandom.com/wiki/Rhetor) ability to modify history (e.g. the scratch on a copper bowl which disappears), and the [Incanters'](https://anathem.fandom.com/wiki/Incanter) ability to observe many different [Hemn spaces](https://anathem.fandom.com/wiki/Hemn_Space) (which is the description of a given system that is used as a "known" or a "given"—or in simpler terms, the basis for an argument. e.g. "If we assume the system state is this, it tautologically follows that...") These are fascinating abilities that tell a profound narrative—but they are far outside the bounds, or the Hemn space, of my own narrative. So we can frame these abilities as a way to broaden our understanding; not necessarily guidance on how to act in the world.

One of the most interesting colloquial perspectives to pull out from the book is a specific religion; the [Religion of the Condemned Man](https://share.google/aimode/iAkUjGKNf4kxBxVeG).  (i'm sorry for using AI, please forgive me.) The way it goes, is that there is a condemned man who is on trial—a final stay, to attempt to sway the court so that he manue continue to live. This is a trial for a death sentence (read: end of a narrative), and the condemned man must convince the jury that although he made many mistakes—his actions were ultimately moral.

To walk the line of morality is to walk the line of calculated risk—literally, the ability to make the best possible decision you can, given your hemn space—the tautological knowledge of what is, and the bounds of that knowledge to what you do not know yet.

Each and every one of us are a branched narrative the Condemned Man paints, and so it is our duty to continue the story, by living in line with that risk. We **must** put ourselves into situations that are fundamentally uncomfortable, due to our lack of complete knowledge. And more than that—we **must** develop the ability to make good judgements—(fine-tuned calculated risks)—by expanding our Hemn space.

And so, in this, we find the purpose of life: to learn lessons, and create beautiful narratives.

**Storytelling** is the [substrate](thesubstrate.co) of the universe. It is what binds the physical to the spiritual. And if you'll notice, the very basis of our humanity is our consciousness—the ability to craft narrative. This is our superpower. This is what it means to manifest, to enact magic on the world, to create art through the act of living.

This is self-actualization. In each lifetime, we—the collective of individual, fractal narratives that bundle into a river of threads—contribute to our shared understanding of ourselves; to lower our spiritual entropy through efficient use of our physical entropy; to walk the line of a Kelx (calculated risk taker). If an increase of entropy is the fraying of one thread into many (i.e. fibers, [lower levels of consciousness](https://youtu.be/iHVGe--xDDA?si=lWDjvk3GTITH9Dcr) that meet at a cross-section of our own), then through that thread an even denser, pure fiber extends to become the main thread. The true thread. This process continues fractally, until we reach the singularity—the moment where physical entropy reaches its max, and the spiritual entropy becomes one.

But we will never reach "the end," because the fractals continue infinitely. And our human brains simply, literally, do not have the capcity to hold infinity.

This limitation is the hemn space of the narrative I find myself in. I speak for each and every one of us when I say that "I am on the truest thread." My life, and the actions in which I take, **are** the [Hylaean Theoric World](https://anathem.fandom.com/wiki/Hylaean_Theoric_World). These are, tautologically, the only actions I **can** take, given the narratives that contributed to this very moment. My self-actualization has reached a specific density (of entropy), and uses that density to create the truest narrative.

The efficiency is determined by the coefficient between yin and yang—the spiritual and the physical, respectively. The coefficient represents the difference in spiritual entropy and physical entropy. Now, there will never be imbalance between yin and yang, because they are fundamentally tied together. (Note: This is the reason the trial of the condemned man keeps going into infinity; never presumed guilty, never presumed innocent.) But we can go deeper, denser I can go into both yin and yang, and in doing this we increase the coefficient. (Note: I don't think we can change the exponent, due to the Hemn space we live in.... I think? idk, I'm still figuring this one out.)

Dialetheism is the view that there are statements that are both true and false. A recent realization I was gifted by a person on Threads is that self-actualization is the ability to hold opposites in your brain at once. And in my view, the physical way to achieve this is to find a regulated nervous system that can recover its balance from many shocks.

I use the word find, because all life is the process of discovery—i.e., uncovering the narrative as you go. To live at a high coefficient of calculated risk is to develop a deep intuition towards your ability to choose the "right" branch in the narrative, in the very moment you stand within.

When you have processed much energy, and become very efficient at choosing which energy passes through you (i.e., your sense of **taste**), you develop the ability to see far into the many narratives in front of your eyes. This is why chess is so invigorating—it is a test of people's ability to hold many rich futures in their consciousness at once.

This concept is paralleled by Fraa Jad's completion of the [Teglon](https://anathem.fandom.com/wiki/Teglon)—a puzzle of pieces that requires an extremely specific solution. With the selection of the first two pieces, there is now only one possible way it can all fit together. For us humans, it is impossible to plan how each shape will fit together from the begininng, because with the limits of our Hemn space, our human brains cannot hold together an array of infinite futures, within the bandwidth of its consciouosness. But, that being said, we *can* become attuned to finding the right path—the **only** path, by becoming more self-actualized.

So go! Create your narrative! Get uncomfortable, learn lessons, and densify your thread! Each and every one of us has the supernatural ability to create the world around you. Though in this Hemn space we may not have the ability to manipulate timelines like rhetors or incanters (to navigate back to a previous fork in the road, or merge with another timeline (related: the mandela effect & r/retconned & deja vu)), the closer we can collectively come to each other, the denser our shared narrative & understanding of the world, the closer we collectively get to the Hylaean Theoric World. The right timeline, the **only** narrative we could ever be in.

**Appendix**
- Humans as we know them have an extremely large coefficient of calculated risk. This is because our hemn space (which **IS** the coefficient) is extremely adpet at consciousness.
- Hmm, how do these ideas integrate with the ones from [Blindsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel))?
- Leveling up our degree of self-actualization is equivalent to developing your sense of taste, which is equivalent to understanding more; being able to hold heavier opposites at once; expanding our hemn space; increasing our coefficient; using entropy more efficiently; walking a tighter and tighter line of calculated risk; going into places of discomfort and coming out stronger; regulating your nervous system.
- In this lifetime as humans, in a treacherous world of loneliness, social media, and fucked up attention spans, the first place for us to start and maintain is our nervous systems!! This is how we fight back against the machine!!
- Free will may not exist, because we are a product of already defined narratives (it is only natural that the collision of atoms lead to this next action). But that is a good thing, because it fundamentally means there is no good or bad, there only is. We **do** have a **creative will**—the ability to tell a better story to the jury, the next day—and we develop our creative will by developing our sense of taste: choosing what energy we think contributes to the HTW, and what doesn't. The very essence of our soul is the conscious gatekeeper, who lives in the house known as our brain, our body.


**Why is the ending of Anathem perfect?**
Two reasons. One, it fits the narrative of Stephenson's inability to end a novel in a satisfying way perfectly. I mean, it's just part of his brand at this point.

Two, narratives stretch to infinity. To explore them all is impossible. In this case with Anathem, there are so many interesting threads I wish we got to pull. It's clear that Gan Oso would have a major role to play. It's clear that it's of the utmost importance that Erasmus experienced two alternate narratives with Jad... but we don't get to see it take form. And what about the saecular lineage? What the hell was up with that?

I believe the novel follows the HTW until we land in the narrative where Erasmus wakes up from cryogenic sleep, weeks after the process of peace is established. See, the novel would never end if we continued to stay on the HTW. The HTW is an inherently infinite fractal, so at 932 pages—we *have* to hop off. We don't get to see the whole thing! But we find ourselves in a completely plausible narrative, and a good one at that.
