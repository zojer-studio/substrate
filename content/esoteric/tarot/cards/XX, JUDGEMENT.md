u/KBTarot
> I like the comparisons to [[XI, JUSTICE|JUSTICE]] people give here. While Justice is taking action to bring relationships within the world to balance, Judgment does the same between the physical and the spiritual; this can often be described as a "calling". The other dynamic in the card is the choice you make - are you willing to follow the calling and align yourself with the spiritual plan set forth for you?


u/paisleyrose25:
> This card is acceptance, understanding, and peace. Unlike Justice- which typically deals with an external righting of the scales, Judgement tends to be more internal. It’s making peace with ourselves.

> This Tarot Tuesday the focus is on XX Judgement Reversed
Some common key words associated with XX Judgement Reversed: Self-Doubt, Unwillingness to Learn, Ignoring the Universe, Unfairness, Overly Critical
Judgement is supposed to be a time of moving forward and getting ready to go into the next level of your life. When Judgement appears reversed, it can indicate that you are holding back. That you are doubting or are afraid that you are not ready to move forward. You could still be beating yourself up over mistakes that you have made within this cycle instead of accepting those mistakes and focusing on the lessons you’ve learned from them. You could also be tuning out the Universe when it is calling you to step up and take action. Instead of doing so, you try to ignore the signs and advice from the Universe. You think that if you can’t hear it or you don’t see it, that it will just go away. That is not how the Universe operates though. Judgement reversed can also appear in a reading when you have been overly critical and judgmental of the people surrounding you. You are not not them, and you don’t know what is going on in their life and what lessons they may be learning. Their choices are theirs to make, not yours.
In a relationship reading, Judgement reversed can appear when you need to make a decision about the future of your relationship, but you are not doing so. You know the relationship is unsustainable at its current point, so how are you going to bring change to that? Ending or leaving the relationship could be but one option. There may be other options available to you and your partner. But a decision needs to be made. The issues are not going to go away if you ignore them. If you are single or have recently ended a relationship, Judgement reversed asks you to look back over your relationships and see what lessons you’ve learned from them. Are there certain patterns that have been repeating in your relationships? You cannot break out of those patterns and move on to more healthy options unless you learn not only to recognize those issues but how to deal with those issues if/when they present themselves.
In a career reading, Judgement reversed again is indicating that you need to make a decision about what you want to do. You’re doubting yourself and that is causing you to hesitate when the time for decisive action is now. You know which way you want to go and you know which way will be more beneficial to you. But you will not be able to go that way unless you choose to move. Indecision in itself is a choice. And if you don’t make the decision to take action, then someone else will, and that decision may not benefit you.
In a health reading, Judgement reversed asks you to look at your behaviors and see which habits of yours no longer benefit you. Have you been holding on to things that are causing your health to worsen? You cannot improve your health by doing the same old same old. You have to let go of the negative behaviors and introduce positive behaviors should you want to see improvements.
Spiritually, Judgement reversed indicates that you are ignoring your karmic lessons. Have you been repeating the same problems over and over? Have those issues been getting worse or more dramatic? These are usually key indications that you are missing what the Universe is trying to tell you. Take some time and meditate on the issues. Try and open yourself up to what the Universe is telling you about these issues. You can only move forward away from these issues once you’ve learned what you need to learn.
