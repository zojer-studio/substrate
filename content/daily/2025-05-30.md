Some things I thought about today:
- Today I'm experiencing a sharp [[Bipolar|upswing]]. I took 100mg (double my current dose) of lamotrigine, and was very surprised at how well it evened me out today.
- **Essay: [[The hump of understanding]]**
- When you find yourself in an argument, it is important to determine whether it is in the arena of logic, or the realm of emotion. Neither is better than the other; they're simply different modes of being.
- Dolphins get high off pufferfish, which is just hilarious to me.
