So this is an ongoing theory I'm developing. It's kind of weird that there is this irreversible process in which [[Entropy]] can only increase (in a closed system), right? I think there's a clue here, and I think I've landed on a pretty cool idea which helps illustrate what I believe to be our purpose in life.[^1]

This is an ongoing article. It will take me many attempts to communicate this idea. But I haven't ever heard someone connect the dots in this way, and I hope that writing it out will resonate with people who are also thinking about these ideas.

Shotgun spread:
- Entropy in a closed system (the universe) can only increase
- We use low physical entropy, expel high physical entropy, in exchange for lower spiritual empathy. It's basically the same thing as working out, except you get more cross-pollination.
- Consciousness gives us the capacity to learn.
- Consciousness allows us to categorize; categorization is destruction, while undefinition is creation.
	- The ego's primary function, biologically, is to distinguish what makes **me** different from the people around me. This is a really useful function, because it essentially allows us to establish productive, working relationships with people. However, if this function becomes addled with cancerous cells, it begins to really get in the way of our capacity to learn lessons.
	- The ego is intertwined with your sense of security, and when it feels threatened it will put up walls and deflect any pain that challenges its energy.
	- Life is the process of getting really good at building a healthy ego, or in other words, finding [[Attachment styles|secure attachment]].
	- [[Our purpose in life is to learn lessons]].
- Every time we learn a lesson, we lower our spiritual entropy.
	- This process requires that we increase physical entropy (via physiological pain).
	- Each lesson folds in on itself, compounding.
