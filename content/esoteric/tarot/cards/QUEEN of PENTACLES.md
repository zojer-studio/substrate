### One interpretation:
The queen is grounded. She looks down and sees where her feet meet the earth. You could say that she's not looking at the big picture, because her attention is towards the smaller matters. The day-to-day operations. But you could argue that the big picture doesn't matter; all we have is the present moment, and the Queen of Pentacles is very good at managing what's actually, tangibly, there.


### Another interpretation:
The QUEEN of PENTACLES sits in her garden, gazing lovingly at her posessions. She has grown many a garden, with much success. She's crafty and practical, kind of like a Mackenzie Bezos figure.

She knows what's valuable to her. At the bottom of the card, on the right-hand side, a rabbit is pouncing into the frame, which symbolizes her high energy and fertility. The Queen of Pentacles, therefore, depicts a certain level of success and prosperity. But the rabbit at the bottom cautions us that we should be careful of where we leap when we are chasing that success.

When ==reversed==, she may be overly focused on her posessions. I like to think of her in this situation as a wine mom.



u/No-Court-2969
> She talks about everything you've accomplished, the help you are willing to give others. Definitely a financial freedom card, she's done the work, the hard work, she's been resilient, she's flourished.
> She's grounded, down-to-earth and practical. She's the reminder to connect or reconnect with the earth in some way.
> She's a reminder to question our physical self. What does my body need right now? Is my diet wholesome? Do I need to meditate in nature?
> She talks about comfort and stability in partnerships. Suggests that the home life is a secure and loving environment.
> As a person she could be a Taurus


u/doomweaver:
> I think a big nuance that is missed in the Queen of Pentacles is appreciation. As much as she is an earth card, also consider Taurus and Venus. The Queen loves and appreciates that which is beautiful and valuable to her.
> She's mature enough to know what's important, and wise enough to take the time to "stop and smell the roses" so to speak.
> Yes, she is "of the earth" but I think of her as less to do with finances (I associate that more with the king) and more to do with being grounded and connected to whatever it is that you value.
