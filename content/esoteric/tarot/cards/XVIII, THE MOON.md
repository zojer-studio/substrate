This card is about navigating your emotions. Towers rise up on both sides; each representing lessons you've come to understand. But those lessons you've learned don't fit exactly into this new context—and so you must navigate the confusion of "rules" that have, unfortunately, become stifling, and lost their power.

Something to keep in mind is that the [[MOON]] transits a full degree very two hours. Emotions come and go. Follow the path ahead of you – even if its confusing light obscures your way – and you will come out the side with greater clarity than where you started.
