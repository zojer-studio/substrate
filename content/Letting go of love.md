What do you do, when you love someone who isn't able to love you back? What do you do when you see a glimmer in their eye—a chance, a possibility—potential, kept behind their walls?

You want to break their walls. You want them to lower their walls. You think to yourself, if I do this properly, they will. You feel it in your chest, in your gut, in your groin. Everytime your eyes touch it's like receiving a drop of ambrosia. It's a drug. And slowly, it fogs your vision; no longer do you see them, no longer does the energy circle back like it once did.

How do you let go of that feeling? How do you break the devils grip? The chains sit loose around your neck, but your arms stay at your side. 

You try to raise your walls but when you see *them* they crumble. You meditate, aware of the dynamics playing out in front of your eyes. You see it clearly, but trick yourself into believing—"what if?" It is not so simple to just "let go", because it is not your hand that grips onto them, but rather, your heart. Emotions crash like waves, bpm spiking against your will. Can you control your heart? Can you slow its beat? 

To be in love is to access an infinite well of energy. It fills your cup to the brim, overflowing, and you think to yourself: "look how much I have to give." It carves its way into your soul, creating a valley that widens deeper by the day. But you don't notice the erosion because the flow of water doesn't change; in fact it quickens, blinding you to the havoc it wrecks on your soul.

The river is fueled by glances and shared understanding. A wavelength shared only by the two of you. Two castles across from each other; it seems only natural to build that bridge. But it's just you building the bridge. And with every beam of wood you place, alone, you demonstrate that they don't need to do the work. You demonstrate that this is a one way street—gates flinging open, energy channeled without the slightest bit of work.

You see, this is no basis for a relationship. There is no [[Teamwork|teamwork]] at play here. It is the most difficult thing in the world to put the beam of wood down. To take a second to breathe, lean against the wall, and look at your handiwork. And what makes it difficult is the river that flows at your back—pushing you along, to the point where it seems like no effort for you at all. Seeing that bridge take shape is exciting.

But when the bridge is built exclusively from one end, the foundations start to crumble. The uneven weight distribution strains the wood, micro cracks expanding inside. 

And so the only thing to do is to strengthen your walls. To take those beams and shore up those holes. To close your gate, and redirect the flow of water elsewhere. It's painful to see that water trickle over; wasted, useless. "What do I do with this excess energy?" you wonder. But the only thing to be done is to take a deep breath, and dive below. Strain through the discomfort, withstand the mounting pressure, and hammer in some nails.

It ain't much, but it's honest work. And as you rebuild your walls, here's the funny thing. You get to control its flow. You can open the gates, just a crack—and who knows? Maybe you'll find someone at the otherside, building the bridge all on their own. And if it's right—true partnership may start to form.
