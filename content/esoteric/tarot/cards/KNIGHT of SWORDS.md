The Knight of Swords wants to figure out the truth of the matter. He wants to dig into it and sus it out. He is aggressive in his mission, horse at full gallop. He is assertive but impatient. Intellectual but tactless. Focused, but arrogant. He is an impulsive communicator; someone driven by their emotions (as opposed to someone lost in their own world, like the [[PAGE of SWORDS]]). He over-communicatesâ€”too much, all at once.

Yes, sometimes the situation needs fast action, sharp decision-making. But other times, especially when reversed, it is a good idea to consider slowing down, pulling away from tunnel-vision, and looking at the big picture.



u/Roselily808:
> To me, the knight of swords is on a pursuit of knowledge and truth. One who wields intelligence like a sword. Someone who will stop at nothing to reach it. 
> Whenever I get this card I feel reminded that I shouldn't forget other people along the way. To not bulldoze over people even though I want to storm forward.
