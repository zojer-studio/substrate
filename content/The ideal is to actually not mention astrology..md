I was talking to someone (on the phone) about a messy relationship in their life, and kind of went into selfish-therapist mode. I got *really* curious about their birth charts, and obtained them. There's some pretty interesting stuff in there, but he communicated that he didn't want to talk about astrology. That he didn't want to intellectualize.

This is an important lesson to learn! When people truly open up, you're no longer in the arena of logic. Emotions are the name of the game, and the channel through which astrology insights must come out is in that emotional language.

But yeah, anyways, I think it'd be cool to become a professional [[Astrologer]]
